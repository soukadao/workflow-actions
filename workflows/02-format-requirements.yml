            ## Requirements (To-Be)

            <!--
            Convert the requirements into a table format:

            |       ID       |     Requirement    |
            | -------------- | ------------------ |
            | R001           | [First requirement]   |
            | R002           | [Second requirement]  |

            - Extract all requirements from the issue
            - Number them sequentially as R001, R002, R003, etc.
            - Be specific and concise
            -->

            Guidelines:
            - Extract the main purpose/objective and place it in the Purpose section
            - Identify all requirements and list them in the table with sequential IDs
            - Format dates as YYYY-MM-DD
            - Generate the entire document in the same language as the issue content (including headers, labels, and all text)
            - Detect the language of the issue and use that language for the entire document
